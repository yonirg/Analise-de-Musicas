Night Visions,It's Time,"So this is what you meant When you said that you were spent And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit?

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell Right to the top, don't look back Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check I don't ever wanna let you down I don't ever wanna leave this town 'Cause after all This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? This road never looked so lonely This house doesn't burn down slowly To ashes, to ashes It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? "

Live at the Moody Theater,it´s time,"So this is what you meant When you said that you were spent And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit? Right to the top, don't hold back Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check I don't ever wanna let you down I don't ever wanna leave this town 'Cause after all This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it?

So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell Right to the top, don't look back Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check I don't ever wanna let you down I don't ever wanna leave this town 'Cause after all This city never sleeps at night It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am? It's time to begin, isn't it? I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit I'm just the same as I was Now, don't you understand That I'm never changing who I am?
